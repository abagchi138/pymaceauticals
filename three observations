Three Observations Made from the analysis

1. The tumor volume at infubnol was one of the largest, and had the only outlier of the dataset

2. The tumor volume goes down as time passes by when specifically using the Capomulin drug, showing that it is an effective drug

3. The heavier the weight the larger the tumor is likely to be, the scatterplot showed a positive trending correlation with that
